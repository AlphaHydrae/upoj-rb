# upoj-rb

Ruby scripting utilities.

This gem is a collection of ruby dependencies which I have found useful
for scripting, as well as a few additions to existing classes such as
OptionParser.

## Using

You can install upoj-rb on the command line:

   gem install upoj-rb

Or add it to your project's Gemfile:

   gem 'upoj-rb'

Then require and use it:

   require 'upoj-rb'
   puts Upoj::VERSION
